                1: What is the differences between var, let and const?
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Before ES6, var was the most used keyword to declare variables.
                But day by day, developers were facing many problems with 'var'
                as it hoists declaration at the top. Even it has no block-scope
                which is most annoying to many developers.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                After the innovation of ES6, var has no longer necessity as let
                and const have better effect.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Let and Const are almost same withoug one point: the variable
                declared with let can be reassigned but in case of const, it's
                impossible.

                2: What is the differences between Arrow function and Regular
                function?
            </h5>
            <p class="ms-5">
                There are a lot of ways to declare functins in javascript. One
                of them is regular function and the other one is arrow function.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                A regular function can easily construb objects while an arrow
                function can't be used as a constructor
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                We know, arrow function of just one line expression is called
                inline arrow function. It returns the value implicitly. It's a
                special case which doesn't present in regular function. Because,
                if you omit return statement in regular function, it returns
                implicitly 'undefined'!

            <h5 class="fw-bold">1: Why do we use template string?</h5>
            <p class="ms-5">Template string is very useful.</p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Generally, we can declare string in 3 ways and one of them is
                Template string. If you need to use multi-line string, then
                template string comes forward helping you.
            </p>
            <p class="ms-5">
                Moreover, it's very common to use dynamic string. So, template
                string helps to use variables in string and thus makes the
                strings <dynamic!></dynamic!>
